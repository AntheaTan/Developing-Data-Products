# Developing-Data-Products

This application is a course project of Coursera's Developing Data Products course.

This application is based on the Motor Trend Car Road Tests dataset. The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

This dataset is included in R datasets and can be obtained by executing R command

### data(mtcars)

from R console.

You can perform basic data exploratory analysis by building three types of plots: Standard Plot, Box Plot and Pair Plot. 

Different data variables of this dataset are used: one as predictor, what we have to choose, and the other is 'mpg' as the outcome, or selecting among different data variables and observing the dependencies.

It is simple to use and when the different predictor is selected the plot is updated putting the new fit.
